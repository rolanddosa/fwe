                <br/>
                <h5>Government and Policy</h5>
                <p>Stable policies play the key role of attracting investments. Unstable policies
                    with frequent changes are undesired.<br/>
                </p><br/>
                <h5>Green Banks</h5>
                <p>Entities that will act as intermediaries in handling financing. They bring expertise and specialise
                    in the sector,
                    providing confidence to investors.
                </p>
                <br/>
                <br/>
                <h5>Private Investments</h5>
                <p>Most of the funding in renewable energy comes from the private sector. Individuals and companies
                    are increasingly incorporating environmentally friendly features in their missions (i.e. Google's <a
                        href="https://sustainability.google/projects/announcement-100/"
                        target="_blank">commitment</a> to running their operations on 100% renewable energy).<br/>
                </p>
                <br/>
                <br/>
                <h5><a>Crowdfunding Platforms</a></h5>
                <p>Crowdfunding has two main advantages:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li type="i">Supporting renewable energy project developers with access to financing</li>
                    <li type="i">Making investments accessible to the part of the public who wish to support
                        projects
                        with small investments
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>Strong support for the renewable energy crowdfunding is shown by the <a
                    href="http://www.crowdfundres.eu/index.html@p=4.html"
                    target="_blank">CROWDFUNDRES</a> project,
                    with funding from the European Union Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme.</p>

                <br/>
                <h5><a>Job Creation</a></h5>
                <p>"Compared with fossil fuel technologies, which are typically mechanized and capital intensive, the renewable energy industry is more labor intensive. Solar panels need humans to install them; wind farms need technicians for maintenance.

                    This means that, on average, more jobs are created for each unit of electricity generated from renewable sources than from fossil fuels." UCSUSA.org</p>
