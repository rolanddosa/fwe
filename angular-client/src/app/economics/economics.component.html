  <h3>The Economics</h3><br/>
  <h5>Government and Policy</h5>
  <p>Stable policies play the key role of attracting investments. Unstable policies
    with frequent changes are undesired.<br/>
  </p><br/>
  <h5>Green Banks</h5>
  <p>Entities that will act as intermediaries in handling financing. They bring expertise and specialise in the sector,
    providing confidence to investors.<br/>
  </p><br/>
  <h5>Private Investments</h5>
  <p>Most of the funding in renewable energy comes from the private sector. Individuals and companies
    are increasingly incorporating environmentally friendly features in their missions (i.e. Google's
    <a href="https://sustainability.google/projects/announcement-100/" target="_blank">commitment</a>
    to running their operations on 100% renewable energy).<br/>
